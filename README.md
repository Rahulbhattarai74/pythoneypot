# 🕵️ Python Honeypot

A **honeypot** built in Python to simulate vulnerable services and log potential intrusions.  
This project is designed for research, learning, and monitoring malicious activity in a controlled environment.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates a vulnerable TCP service (default: port 2222)
- Captures and logs attacker input (commands, payloads, etc.)
- Saves logs to `logs/honeypot.log`
- Easy to configure and extend for more services
- Safe for use inside VM or isolated environments

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pyhoneypot.git
   cd pyhoneypot

2.Create a virtual environment (recommended)

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows

3.Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt


4.Run the honeypot
    python main.py

🔍 Usage

By default, the honeypot listens on port 2222.
Logs are stored in:
        logs/honeypot.log
You can change the port and log path in config/honeypot.conf.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This honeypot is for educational and research purposes only.
Run it only inside isolated environments (VMs or lab networks).
Deploying on open internet may attract real attackers. Use responsibly!

Would you like me to also give you a **cool ASCII banner (like hacker-style “PYHONEYPOT” art)** to add at the top of the README so it looks even more attractive on GitHub?
